    <p class="content">
      Hi my name is John and I want to be the best developer I can be! I am a computer science student with a keen
      desire to be an awesome software developer. I got into software development because I am interested in
      solving problems and delivering value to someone (even if it is just me!). My career objective is to work
      with the Web as I am very interested in cloud computing and love to use and create Web Services to work with
      my mobile apps. I love to travel and regularly go on weekend adventures. I am always planning my next trip
      and like to discuss travel with fellow travellers. I am also an avid listener of music with classic rock
      being my best genre. I am currently getting into jazz at the moment with ambitions of playing the saxophone.
      I am the kind of person who likes to find out how things work (whether it be a new programming language or a
      toaster) and always have a side project that involves discovering something new.
